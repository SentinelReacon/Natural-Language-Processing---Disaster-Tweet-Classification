# Natural Language Processing - Disaster Tweet Classification
This project is based on classfying tweets whether they are about disasters or not. In this project, basic Natural language processing is used and for classification Deep learning models are used such as *Bidirectional LSTM cells*. I have also used **Pre-Trained BERT model** as a better model for classification. 
The datasets for the project are also attached and they are in csv formats.
